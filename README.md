# Network Management Discipline Repository

This repository is dedicated to storing the assignments and projects completed for the Network Management course. The course covers various aspects of network management, including device discovery, SNMP, and MIB implementation.

## Assignments

### Assignment 1: Device Discovery Algorithm

**Description:**
The first assignment focused on the development of a device discovery algorithm capable of identifying and listing devices connected to the same network as the algorithm itself.

**Files:**
- `networkdiscoverer.py`: Python script containing the implementation of the device discovery algorithm.
- `discovery_history.json`: Sample output of the algorithm showcasing the discovered devices.

### Assignment 2: SNMP MIB2 Implementation

**Description:**
The second assignment involved the implementation of a Management Information Base (MIB2) for SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol). The MIB2 defines a standardized set of objects for managing network devices.

**Files:**
- `mib.mib`: MIB file containing the definition of SNMP objects for the managed network devices.

### Assignment 3: SNMP Agent Implementation

**Description:**
The third assignment focused on building an SNMP agent capable of interacting with the implemented MIB. The SNMP agent responds to queries and performs actions based on the defined SNMP objects in the MIB2.

**Files:**
- `main.py`: Python script containing the implementation of the SNMP agent.
